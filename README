This is my final project for an Art class I took in college. Original designs
were created in Adobe XD, which I received in-class feedback for from by peers,
and all programming was done on a simple HTML/CSS/JS (no libraries or
preprocessors) page.

The site is live at cjcarrick.github.io/arts-177.

See the mockup (mockup.pdf) for more pages that I designed but did not implement
in code.

It features a responsive design, so the site works just as well on desktop as it
does on mobile.
